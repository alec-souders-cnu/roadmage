# Roadmage

This is a short description of what each of the files do.

- amazon-cognito-identity.min.js and amazon-cognito-auth.min.js are provided by Amazon and are necessary for the integration of Cognito into my website
- config.js holds the information that will establish the connection to my Cognito User Pool
- home.html is where the map for RoadMage's service is displayed
- profile.html is where a user's name is displayed, as well as a button that links to the register.html page for retaking the survey
- register.html is where the user fills out the questions that are to be stored in the AWS RDS database for later access by the frustration index calculation
- signout.html is a very simple signout page
